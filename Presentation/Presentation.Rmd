#i made the code invisible again 
```

```


## Raw Data/Manipulation
1) Raw data orginally came from [Raw larval abundance and environmental data for Thompson et al.](https://figshare.com/articles/Raw_larval_abundance_and_environmental_data_for_Thompson_et_al_from_Larval_abundances_of_rockfishes_that_were_historically_targeted_by_fishing_increased_over_16_years_in_association_with_a_large_marine_protected_area/5394619) 
2) Raw data includes 27 rockfish speices and 23 environmental/descriptive factors.
3) There are about 10,000 pieces of data in the raw data set.
4) Some of the descriptive factors were not needed for the analysis and were cut out using dplyr. 
5) A new column was added using knitr to gather species into a genus column.



## Data Table 
The new data set is shown here: 
```{r raw_data}
rockfish_larval_data <- read.csv("../data/rsos170639_si_001.csv")

#downloading the raw data
```


```{r}
rockfish_data_reduced <- select(rockfish_larval_data, year, line, station, station.depth, temp_surf, sal_surf, oxygen_surf, temp_100m, sal_100m, oxygen_100m, auriculatus, aurora,	caurinus,	chlorostictus,	constellatus,crameri,	crocotulus,	dalli,	did.not.work,	diploproa,	elongatus,	ensifer,	entomelas,	flavidus,	gilli,	goodei, helvomaculatus,	hopkinsi,	jordani,	levis,	macdonaldi,	melanostomus,	miniatus,	moseri,	mystinus,	ovalis,	paucispinis)

#selecting the specific columns I want for my revised data
```

```{r}
rockfish_data_added_genus <- rockfish_data_reduced %>%
  gather('auriculatus', 'aurora',	'caurinus',	'chlorostictus',	'constellatus', 'crameri',	'crocotulus',	'dalli',	'did.not.work',	'diploproa',	'elongatus',	'ensifer',	'entomelas',	'flavidus',	'gilli',	'goodei', 'helvomaculatus',	'hopkinsi',	'jordani',	'levis',	'macdonaldi',	'melanostomus',	'miniatus',	'moseri',	'mystinus',	'ovalis',	'paucispinis', key = "genus", value = "counts")

#combining all of the species columns into one new column called genus
```


```{r}
knitr::kable(
  rockfish_data_added_genus[1:7, 5:11 ], 
  caption = "Rockfish Data Table"
) %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

#making a pretty table for the slide show, incorporating the first 7 rows and the latter columns that I used in my analysis
```




## Overview on Data
* A total of 16 years of data collected along Californian Coast.

* Rockfish were historically targeted by fishing for many years. 

* Environmental factors consist of 

    -temperatures ![](https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2018/temperature.jpg){width=15%}
    
    -salinities ![](https://images.wagwalkingweb.com/media/articles/dog/salt-poisoning/salt-poisoning.jpg){width=15%}
    
    -oxygen concentrations ![](https://visualisingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/O2-bubbles.jpg){width=15%}



## Rockfish at Surface Temp and Temp at 100m
```{r}
ggplot(rockfish_data_added_genus, aes(x=temp_surf)) +
   geom_histogram(fill="red", alpha = 0.3, bins = 50) +
   labs(x = "Temp (C)") +
  facet_wrap(~genus) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=temp_100m), fill="blue", alpha = 0.3, bins = 50) 

#first histogram overlapping surface temp and 100 m temp with all species  
```
Blue: 100 meters deep
Red: surface 
 
 
## Rockfish at Surface Salinity and Salinity at 100m

```{r}
ggplot(rockfish_data_added_genus, aes(x=sal_surf)) +
   geom_histogram(fill="red", alpha = 0.3, bins = 50) +
   labs(x = "Salinity") +
   facet_wrap(~genus) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=sal_100m), fill="blue", alpha = 0.3, bins = 50)

#second histogram overlapping surface salinity and 100 m salinty with all species  

```


## Rockfish at Surface O2 Concentration and O2 Concentration at 100m 
```{r}
ggplot(rockfish_data_added_genus, aes(x=oxygen_surf)) +
   geom_histogram(fill="red", alpha = 0.3, bins = 50) +
   labs(x = "Dissolved Oxygen Concentration") +
   facet_wrap(~genus) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=oxygen_100m), fill="blue", alpha = 0.3, bins = 50)

#third histogram overlapping surface O2 and 100 m O2 with all species  

```

## The Code for Histograms 

   
ggplot(rockfish_data_added_genus, aes(x=temp_surf)) +
   geom_histogram(fill="red", alpha = 0.3, bins = 50) +
   labs(x = "Temp (C)") +
   facet_wrap(~genus) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=temp_100m), fill="blue", alpha = 0.3, bins = 50)

## Why do we care about this info?
* larval abundance was evenely distributed between suface and deeper temperatures

* salinity did not change at surface and deeper depths

* larval abundance was unevenely distributed between different oxygen concentrations 

* with this knowledge of larval abundance at different environmental conditions we could potentially 
  + farm rockfish in better conditions
  + avoid areas of high larval abundance when fishing
